    /// the top line of the staff (y).

    /// element - all children of the direction-type element

    /// This origin is from the start of the entire measure, at either the left barline or the start of the system.
    ///
    /// When the default-x attribute is used within a child element of the part-name-display, part-abbreviation-
    /// display, group-name-display, or group-abbreviation-display elements, it changes the origin relative to the
    /// start of the first measure on the system. These values are used when the current measure or a succeeding
    /// measure starts a new system. The same change of origin is used for the group-symbol element.
    ///
    /// For the note, figured-bass, and harmony elements, the default-x value is considered to have adjusted the
    /// musical position within the bar for its descendant elements.
    ///
    /// Since the credit-words and credit-image elements are not related to a measure, in these cases the default-x
    /// and default-y attributes adjust the origin relative to the bottom left-hand corner of the specified page.
    ///
    /// The relative-x and relative-y attributes change the position relative to the default position, either as
    /// computed by the individual program, or as overridden by the default-x and default-y attributes.
    ///
    /// Positive x is right, negative x is left; positive y is up, negative y is down. All units are in tenths of
    /// interline space. For stems, positive relative-y lengthens a stem while negative relative-y shortens it.

    /// accuracy. For the relative-x and relative-y attributes, the offset element, placement attribute, and directive
    /// attribute provide context for the relative position information, so the two features should be interpreted
    /// together.
